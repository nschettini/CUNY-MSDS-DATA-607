This position will lead data collection and analysis for all of our products, helping the product and editorial teams make better-informed decisions and optimize their efforts to serve and grow Quartz&rsquo;s audience.</p>
<p>We have a diverse array of products with rich usage data and interesting challenges: QZ.com, our flagship website; the Quartz Daily Brief and four other popular emails; apps for iOS and Android; Atlas, a user-generated charted platform; and more. These are created by a talented group of designers, engineers, and product managers with whom you would work every day. And you would do it all within a forward-thinking newsroom that puts its users first and foremost.</p>
<p><b>The Data Scientist will:</b></p>
<ul><li>analyze key questions about our products and their users;</li>
<li>know the questions we should be asking of our data;</li>
<li>implement a variety of algorithms (e.g. supervised and unsupervised machine learning, Bayesian MCMC) to support important product decisions</li>
<li>develop models for data collection in our products;</li>
<li>proactively study our data for new insights</li>
</ul><p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a big job! And it&rsquo;s a new role for us, though you won&rsquo;t be on your own in working with data at Quartz. You would be joining our analytics team, which consists of several analysts, data engineers, and a product scientist. And we have robust tracking on most of our existing products, which means you&rsquo;d have rich data with which to work on day one.</p>
<p>To be successful in this job, you will of course need experience as a data scientist, product analyst, or something similar. And we also expect you will bring technical skills to the role: proficiency with big data cloud solutions and open source analytic tools. Experience with Python (Pandas and Scikit-Learn) is preferred, though we don&rsquo;t insist on a particular language. It&rsquo;s important that you can analyze and visualize data on your own.</p>
<p>Previous experience in media isn&rsquo;t crucial, but it could definitely help.

Most importantly, you should be a voice for the value of data and importance of rigorous analysis in a newsroom environment.</p>
<p>This job reports to the director of analytics. Candidates who can work in our New York office are strongly preferred, since our entire product team is located there, but we&rsquo;ll consider applications from other locations. Please include with your application a cover letter and, if at all possible, a sample of your work in data science (github repo, a report, or other indication of what you can do).</p>

<h2 class="jobSectionHeader">Who You'll Work With
</h2>You’ll work with our Healthcare Analytics & Delivery team based in several office locations. Healthcare Analytics & Delivery is part of McKinsey’s New Ventures.
<br>
<br>
The Healthcare Analytics & Delivery team uses healthcare data (payer / provider / 3rd party data) and analytics to answer some of the most pressing questions our healthcare clients have today such as “How do we manage cost of care while improving quality?”, “How do we remain competitive in the evolving healthcare landscape?”, “Who are the most vulnerable patients and what interventions can we design to better care for them?”.
<br>
<br>
Our capabilities are foundational to multiple high profile initiatives and have been core to the Healthcare practice in delivering organization wide transformation programs for payors (public and private) or providers. The team has grown to 200+ colleagues globally over the last 4 years. It is a unique mix of Healthcare Experts, physicians, statisticians, engineers, data scientists, and more.
<br>
<br>
New Ventures fosters innovation driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile and social by developing new products and services and and integrating them into our client work. It is helping to shift our medel toward asset-based consulting and is a foundation for—and expands our investment in—our entrepreneurial culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it means to work with McKinsey.

<h2 class="jobSectionHeader">What You'll Do
</h2>You will be an important contributor to the success of any Healthcare Analytics & Delivery projects by participating in the problem-solving effort to design, deliver and maintain one or more models or algorithms.
<br>

<br>
<br>
You’ll have the opportunity to develop an expertise on at least one Healthcare Analytics asset (e.g., a specific model or a specific episode of care). You’ll also participate in IP development projects, contributing to the overall knowledge and capabilities of Healthcare Analytics. Additionally, you’ll develop a strong knowledge base related to healthcare payment innovation (e.g., Episode-based payment models, PCMH, ACO, Health Homes, Capitation models) and of claims data (e.g., ICD-9 codes, CPT codes, pharmacy claims coding). You will be involved in working with multiple clients and assets at the same time, and may be responsible for managing a project autonomously.
<br>
<br>
Flexibility exists to hire at the junior analyst, analyst, or senior analyst level depending on a candidate’s experience and related expertise. Those hired as senior analysts who perform exceptionally well can expect to subsequently be promoted to the specialist level.

<br>
Researchers on the Google Brain team have the freedom to set their research agenda and to engage as much or as little as they wish with existing products, choosing between doing more basic, methodological research or more applied research as necessary to produce the most compelling results. Because many of the advances we develop today may take years to become useful, the team as a whole maintains a portfolio of projects across this spectrum. It is our philosophy that making substantive progress on hard applications can help drive and sharpen the research questions we study, and in turn scientific breakthroughs can spawn entirely new applications.
<br>
<br>
The Google Brain team’s research focuses on methods that can learn multiple layers of rich, non-linear feature extractors and can scale to large amounts of data. Much of our work is best understood as part of the deep learning subfield of machine learning, but we are interested in any methods capable of efficient and effective feature learning that get good results on challenging problems. We have resources and access to projects impossible to find elsewhere. Our broad and fundamental research goals allow us to collaborate closely with and–contribute uniquely to–many different product teams across the company.

<span id="job_summary" class="summary"><p>The Neuroscience Group at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Biology (CCB) seeks researchers with various levels of experience. Depending on levels of experience, positions may be at-will Research Scientists; or, term-appointment Flatiron Research Fellows or Associate Research Scientists.
<br>
<br>
The primary mission of the CCB is to create new computational frameworks that will enable scientists to analyze the large and complex data sets that are being generated by new experimental technologies. Tremendous opportunities for discovery are emerging in the biological and biomedical sciences, as well as in traditional physical and social sciences, but they will require the combined power of theory, data analysis, and simulation. In the biomedical sciences, for example, researchers are being confronted by an explosion of information from genome sequencing, gene expression profiling, proteomics, multi-electrode recording, and multiple high-resolution imaging modalities. The focus remains on problems arising in biophysical modeling, genomics, neuroscience, and structural biology, collaborating closely with experimental colleagues.
<br>
<br>
The goal of the Neuroscience group is to understand how the brain analyzes large and complex datasets streamed by sensory organs in order to aid efforts at building artificial neural systems and treating mental illness. The group does so by analyzing experimental data, assembling connectomes from high-throughput electron microscopy and determining neuronal dynamics from calcium imaging and multi-electrode recordings.
<br>
<br>
Researchers will develop algorithms for analyzing high-dimensional datasets of brain activity obtained experimentally, for example, via multi-neuronal calcium imaging. Specifically, work on neural dimensionality reduction (i.e., extracting a low-dimensional neural subspace that captures much of the observed variance) will be required. Researchers will explore methods for inferring synaptic connectivity from large-scale calcium imaging and will develop methods that scale favorably with the number of dimensions and avoid the trap of overfitting. Furthermore, researchers will work in collaboration with experimentalists and theorists on the interpretation of these datasets - in particular, the exploration of whether neuronal computation can be modeled by nonnegative matrix factorization.
<br>
<br>
This position will be based, and have a principle office or workspace, at the foundation.

The Planning Algorithms team offers a unique opportunity within the Learnvest organization. At the heart of the acquisition in 2015, our planning software has been used to deliver thousands of financial plans to households across the U.S. We are actively scaling our tools to be used by Northwestern Mutual's X+ field representatives who deliver over Y financial plans per year. Our representatives work with a diversity of households with a wide range of needs, and we are looking for talented engineers to help us expand our financial modeling capabilities to meet them. As a platform team, we provide the simulation architecture that enables planners to create robust models of their clients' lives and deliver advice to help them reach their financial goals.</p><p>
Members of our team generally follow one of two tracks. We expect all of our developers to gain exposure to both, though most developers will specialize in one or the other.</p><p><b>
Core Simulation Engine</b></p><p>
This group is responsible for providing a robust simulation engine that our Scenarios and Optimizations team uses to rapidly prototype scenarios reflecting the impacts of various planning strategies. Responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>
Modeling cashflow trajectories and providing an API for allocating surplus and covering deficits</li><li>
Modeling various financial instruments including a range of debt types, pensions, annuities and various securities</li><li>
Simulating portfolio growth and distribution strategies</li><li>
Working with data scientists to formalize predictive models</li><li>
Working with our architecture team to meet our scaling needs</li></ul><p><b>
Scenarios and Optimizations</b></p><p>
This group is responsible for leveraging the core simulation engine to build scenarios our interface teams use to assist the planner in making recommendations for their clients and demonstrating the benefit of that advice. Responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>
Designing and implementing optimization techniques for allocation and distribution strategies</li><li>
Build an array of what-if scenarios to model the impact of client behavior</li><li>
Evaluate planner-driven and algorithmically generated recommendations.</li><li>
Analyze the impact of changes to our advice on our client population</li><li>
Support a GraphQL based API to make our simulation data widely available to partner teams</li></ul><p><b>
Candidate Requirements</b></p><ul><li>
Either:<ul><li>
A strong background in engineering complex software systems <b>OR</b></li><li>
A strong background in financial modeling with some professional programming experience</li></ul></li><li>
Candidates with less finance experience will be expected to go through a rigorous onboarding process to learn those skills</li></ul><ul><li>
Willingness to embrace functional programming paradigms (and Scala)</li></ul><p>
Finally, we do not believe that whiteboarding problems or brain teasers are at all indicative of a candidate&rsquo;s ability to perform well. Instead, we prefer candidates to demonstrate a capacity for the type of work they would actually complete. Candidates will be asked to perform a challenging, but fair coding assignment, with an emphasis on design skills and an ability to work with financial subject matter. Candidates with a background in finance can expect to spend 3-4 hours on the assignment. Candidates without that experience should factor in additional time to research and internalize the material.</p><p><b>

<span id="job_summary" class="summary">The Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, whose goals are to apply large scale human genetics to identify new drug targets and to guide the development of therapeutics programs and precision medicine. Building upon Regeneron's strengths in mouse genetics and genetics-driven drug discovery and development, the RGC specializes in ultra-high-throughput exome sequencing, large scale informatics and data analysis encompassing genomics and electronic health records, and translating genetic discoveries into new biology and drug discovery opportunities. The RGC leverages multiple approaches including large population based studies, Mendelian genetics and family based studies, founder population genetics, and large-scale disease focused projects and has developed a network of over 50 collaborations with research organizations around the world. Including some of the largest sequencing studies in the world, such as the DiscovEHR study in collaboration with Geisinger Health System, and an initiative to sequence 500,000 participants with the UK Biobank, the RGC has built one of the largest human genetics databases, including sequence data from over several hundred thousand participants and rapidly growing. Our interests encompass a breadth of different areas across all therapeutic areas and the RGC is highly integrated into all facets of research and development at Regeneron. Program goals include target discovery, indication discovery, and patient-disease stratification. Objectives include advancing basic science around the world through public sharing of discoveries, providing clinically-valuable insights to physicians and providers of collaborating health-care systems, improving patient outcomes, and identifying novel targets for drug development.<br>
<br>
Summary<br>
<br>
The Head of Immune, Respiratory, and Infectious Diseases Therapeutic Area Genetics will be a member of the leadership team at the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC) whose goals are the application of large scale human genetics to identify new drug targets, to guide the development of therapeutics programs, and to identify genetic predictors of drug response. Roles and responsibilities will include leading human genetics projects in furtherance of these goals in these therapeutic areas; ; these efforts will require extensive partnership with preclinical research teams (Therapeutic Focus Area teams), Clinical Development, and other R&amp;D functions at Regeneron. The role will also require close partnership with RGC&rsquo;s Analytical Genetics team who will provide expertise and collaborate in the development of study designs and statistical analysis plans and conduct analyses, producing results for interpretation and translational follow up. The Head will be responsible for continuing to build resources and new external collaborations (samples for sequencing and new datasets) that will strengthen RGC&rsquo;s portfolio of immune, respiratory, and infectious disease genetics projects and discovery capabilities. Primary responsibilities will include novel gene discovery with an emphasis on large effect size genetic discoveries and those with translational potential (i.e. large unmet medical need, therapeutic interests, etc) as new targets or areas of biology to explore at Regeneron. The goals and outputs of these research programs are to feed novel candidate genes into (1) downstream research teams studying target biology and (2) drug discovery teams developing therapeutics against these targets, leveraging Regeneron&rsquo;s capabilities in antibody drug discovery, as well as other modalities (e.g. small molecules, CRISPR, gene therapy, etc). These responsibilities will entail leading discovery genetics research supporting the advancement of existing therapeutics programs, by exploring genetic associations in support of target-indication hypotheses, safety considerations, and precision medicine opportunities (i.e. genetically defined patient populations). The role will also entail leading multi-disciplinary efforts in genetics projects involving important immune genes that are in complex regions of the genome requiring alternative technologies and novel methodologies for data generation and analyses; these include HLA genes, KIRs, TCR and BCR repertoires, amongst others. The role and its corresponding research programs will be at the center of discovery science and drug development at Regeneron and involve close partnership with preclinical, clinical, and technology center (molecular profiling, mouse genetics, etc) research teams collectively working towards advancing important new medicines and unlocking new areas of biology.

Our mission is to bring <em>idea meritocracies</em> to the world, in other words, organizations in which the best ideas win. Humans are naturally and historically poor at decision making, and the costs are high: opportunities squandered, businesses wrecked, people hurt. Why? Human ego, frailty, and bias. The idea meritocracy exists to help people get what they want out of life. Our team has set out to systemize a better way for people to work together, to build strong and vibrant communities, and ultimately to achieve world class results. We equip people with the ability to understand one another, thoughtfully disagree, stress test ideas, and compound knowledge through objective decision making.<h1 class="jobSectionHeader"><b>
Team &amp; Product</b></h1>
Dave Ferrucci, the creator of IBM&rsquo;s Watson and founder of Elemental Cognition, has joined forces with Ray Dalio, founder of the largest and most successful hedge fund in history and author of New York Times #1 bestseller, <em>Principles</em>. Together, they lead a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists, and artists creating a platform that combines the best qualities of intelligent systems and intelligent humans.<br>
<br>
By collecting streams of real time experimental and observational data from a large and ever-growing number of sources, we construct and fit statistical, machine learning, and optimization models of people and of work. In a collegial atmosphere we debate modeling of human character, and what is the best ontology to represent it. We ask ourselves questions like: how do we know what people are like? Who is best for a given job? How can we work, together, better, more effectively? And, since we aspire to help people all over the world, we engineer for scale&mdash;a suite of applications built atop a forward thinking scalable and distributed architecture, to sustain a beautiful user experience within a rich ecosystem.

About VelociGene<br>
<br>
To exploit the power of mouse genetics to unlock the function of each gene in the genome, Regeneron scientists developed VelociGene&reg;, a novel, proprietary group of technologies for the modification of the mouse genome.<br>
Eliminating or modifying a single gene in the mouse genome can provide insight into the role that gene plays in normal physiology and disease pathogenesis. The high-throughput of the automated VelociGene technology enables it to provide, as the name implies, the fastest path from gene discovery to assignment of function. In support of the Regeneron drug development programs, VelociGene has delivered unprecedented speed and capacity for the validation of therapeutic targets and the creation of animal models for human disease. Utilizing VelociGene in conjunction with our VelociMouse&reg; method, Regeneron is able to vastly increase the speed and reduce the cost associated with the generation of genetically engineered mice for understanding the function of each gene.<br>
<br>
The versatile VelociGene technology enables the tackling of projects ranging from a single base mutation to multi-gene deletions and the replacement of mouse genes with their human homologs. The pinnacle of the VelociGene technological achievements was the largest mammalian genetic engineering project ever accomplished: the creation of the VelocImmune&trade; mouse &mdash; a mouse capable of producing human antibodies that can serve as specific and potent therapeutics.<br>
<br>
This is an opportunity to join our select team that is already leading the way in the Pharmaceutical/Biotech industry. Apply today and learn more about Regeneron&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to combining good science &amp; good business.<br>
